# 🥋 UFC Data Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project focused on historical and statistical insights into UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) fights and fighters. The project is divided into three main levels of depth: descriptive reports, analytical comparisons, and predictive modeling.

## 1. 🎯 Descriptive Reports

These reports give a general overview of UFC data. They are great for portfolio purposes or stakeholder presentations.

### 📈 UFC Historical Overview ✅
- Evolution of the number of fights per year ✅
- Most frequent host countries and cities ✅
- Distribution of fights per weight class over time ✅

### 🥊 General Fight Statistics ✅
- Win ratio by method: KO/TKO, submission, decision ✅
- Average fight duration per weight class ✅
- Most common submission techniques ✅
- Average strikes per minute or per round ✅

### 🧍 Fighter Statistics ✅
- Top 10 fighters with the most wins ✅
- Fighters with the highest KO rate ✅
- Performance comparison by age ✅
- Average career length of fighters ✅

## 2. 🧠 Analytical & Comparative Reports

These go deeper and highlight analytical thinking, correlations, and behavior patterns.

### 📊 What Influences a Fight Outcome? ✅
- Correlation between height/reach and win probability ✅
- Does making weight increase win chances? ✅
- Do fighters coming off a win have a higher chance of winning again? ✅

### 🤼‍♂️ Rivalries & Rematches ✅
- Timeline of fights between the same opponents (e.g., McGregor vs Poirier) ✅
- Performance evolution across trilogies ✅
- Who tends to improve in rematches? ✅ (explored, but excluded from report — sample size and context variation make it too complex for this study)
